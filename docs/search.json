The AA DLAB summer school at the AA School(Architectural Association School of Architecture) is a 2-week summer programme that experiments with the integration of advanced computational design, analysis, and large-scale prototyping.\n\n\n\nThe completed structure of the FLEX. Rattan canes in bundles of 7 are used as the primary structure - these were bundled together using industrial robotic arms."

Explored datasets include TfL Cycling Data - especially active travel counts and cycling infrastructure, and road collision data also available from TfL.\n\n\n\nDensity of cycling casualties compared to the number of active travel counts (cyclist counts). Darker boroughs indicate there is a relatively higher probability of cycling casualties for cyclists, indicating room for improvement in terms of cyclist safety.\n\n\nAlthough a direct correlation could not be drawn, a case-study based narrative indicates investment on cycling infrastructure may have positive impact in improving cycling safety. Limitations lie in the availability of data, especially the temporal data on infrastructure implementation.\nThe code and analysis outcomes are available on GitHub"
