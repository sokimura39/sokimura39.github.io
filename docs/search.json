Even if the shadows from one building affects an area for a small amount of time, having multiple buildings blocking sunlight leads to having the majority of the day without access to sunlight.\n\n\nOther interesting results included the change in the perception of the transforming skyline, with a new high-rise development being described as a ‘symbolic structure’ in early stages, but later changed into ‘subtle change’ that fits within the given surroundings with multiple high-rises.\n\n\nEngagement from EIAs\nThe engagement from individual development-based EIAs have a spectrum of consideration toward cumulative impacts, depending on the subject. There were issues that were not considered at all (i.e. impact on public transport), issues that had only been considered on an individual basis (right to light, change in skyline) to issues with mitigating measures conducted by the EIA (impact of wind). Not all issues have been considered in the EIA, and some are only considered in an individual scale."

Agents will relocate to a different cell that maximises the amenity for themselves (and others if they are considerate).\n\n\n\nThe variables considered in the model.\n\n\nWork related to my undergraduate dissertation cumulative impact assessment project, considering the externalities of high-rise buildings.\nModel created using the ABM software NetLogo.

Explored datasets include TfL Cycling Data - especially active travel counts and cycling infrastructure, and road collision data also available from TfL.\n\n\n\nDensity of cycling casualties compared to the number of active travel counts (cyclist counts). Darker boroughs indicate there is a relatively higher probability of cycling casualties for cyclists, indicating room for improvement in terms of cyclist safety.\n\n\nAlthough a direct correlation could not be drawn, a case-study based narrative indicates investment on cycling infrastructure may have positive impact in improving cycling safety. Limitations lie in the availability of data, especially the temporal data on infrastructure implementation.\nThe code and analysis outcomes are available on GitHub"

I have also explored the spatial autocorrelation through local Moran’s I analysis, indicating areas that have a relatively high accident rate compared to the surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident density involving e-scooters, aggregated by borough. Central London has more accidents per square km compared to outer London - but given the high density of traffic we cannot immediately conclude these are the unsafe areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Moran’s I for the frequency of accidents in relation to the traffic density. High value indicates accidents are more frequent than the surrounding areas considering the traffic, and low values indicate fewer accidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome interesting trends were observed, indicating areas that may be potentially safer / more dangerous compared to their surrounding boroughs.\nThe full report can be found here.\nThis was done as a final assessment for the Geographic Information Systems and Science module conducted by Dr. Andy MacLachlan.

Weak correlation can be observed.\n\n\nThis seemingly contradictory results provide room for further research, making clear the differences within Santander Cycle usages.\nThe report can be found at the GitHub repository."
