## Overview

This model explores the consideration of externalities of high-rise buildings to the decision-making process, and how that impacts the outcome of the skyline of the city.

In the model, each agent considers the amenity of access to direct sunlight, open space, amount of view that they have outside the property's window, and the price (modelled as more expensive on higher floors).

Selfish agents only care about maximising their own amenity, whereas non-selfish agents consider the reduction of others' amenity as well - the extent to which this is considered is dictated by a global variable. Agents will relocate to a different cell that maximises the amenity for themselves (and others if they are considerate).

Model created using the ABM software [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). Source code available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sokimura39/ABM_assessment/tree/main/assessment_2)
