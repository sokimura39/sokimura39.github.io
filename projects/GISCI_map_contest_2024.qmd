## Overview

The [GISCI Map Contest](https://www.gisci.org/Learn-More/Map-Contest/Previous-Contest-Winners) is an annual map contest hosted by the [GIS Certification Institute](https://www.gisci.org/). This year had no specific theme, and participants were requested to create maps that sparked their mind.

The map shows the estimated locations of where each artwork is believed to be drawn. Among them there is my birthplace (Shimizu, Shizuoka, then called *Ejiri in Suruga Province*) and Senju, Tokyo (then in *Musashi Province*) where I lived for 2 years before moving to the UK; these personal connections with the artwork from the 1830s may have lead to the prize!

## Some Additional Context

A complete set of *Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji* was recently put on auction for a record-breaking $3.5 million - the news was the very reason I chose this as my topic for the map.

Inspired by the [interactive map by CANON Creative Park](https://creativepark.canon/meiga/artmap/fugaku36.html) on the same subject, my addition here is to turn it into a graphic that emphasises the beauty of Mount Fuji worth drawing from 46 different angles!
