## Overview of Project

The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a daily mapmaking challenge that involves creating maps every day in November, with themes assigned for every day.

In 2023 I have created all 30 maps in 30 days, with the majority using R (mainly the packages in `tidyverse` - especially `ggplot2`, `sf`, `terra`, and some `rayshader`).

## Gallery

For maps generated programatically, the code to generate are available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sokimura39/30DayMapChallenge).

```{r echo=FALSE}

library(pixture)

# create paths
days <- seq(1, 30)
paths <- paste0('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sokimura39/30DayMapChallenge/master/2023/Maps/Day', formatC(days, width = 2, flag = '0'), '.png')
