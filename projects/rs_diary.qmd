The [Remote Sensing Learning Diary](https://sokimura39.github.io/RemoteSensingDiary/) is an academic project at UCL CASA, as part of the Remote Sensing Cities and Environment module. The learning diary summarises the content of the module, relevant applications, and personal reflections based on the contents. The website was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), with presentations built using the [`Xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package in R.

A portion of this module was dedicated to creating online portfolios - which was what had motivated me to compiling this website.
