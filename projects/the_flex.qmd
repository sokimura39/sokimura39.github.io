## Overview of Project

The FLEX is a pavilion made of rattan canes making use of active bending techiniques. Parametric design methodologies were implemented in the designing stage using Grasshopper on Rhinoceros. 

This work was a collaborative project as a student at the AA DLAB 2023 in September 2023. The [AA DLAB](https://dlab.aaschool.ac.uk/) summer school at the [AA School(Architectural Association School of Architecture)](https://www.aaschool.ac.uk/) is a 2-week summer programme that experiments with the integration of advanced computational design, analysis, and large-scale prototyping.

## Prototyping

Aside from the cooperative work on building the prototype based on the decided design, my major contribution was the co-designing of the 'foot' - 3D printed attachments to the bottom of the structure, stablising them onto the ground. The physical allocation of connecting beams required consideration.

## Design Proposals

Students were required to create a design proposal in a small group. Our proposal was **The Elephant** (co-designed with Yusuf Alperen Bayir and Sudaksh Nigotiya), an arch-shaped structure using helical modules. The circle is one geometry that self-stabilises under active-bending conditions, which we have utilised as the main structure.
