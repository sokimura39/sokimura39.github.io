## Overview

The University of Tokyo has 2 large campus festivals on their 2 main campuses: the May Festival in May at the Hongo Campus, and the Komaba Festival in November at the Komaba Campus. I was involved in the public relations, graphic design, and wayfinding for 3 years during my undergraduate studies, serving as the Director of Public Relations at the Komaba Festival in 2016 and the May Festival in 2018. Other roles include publishing leader and wayfinding team.
