## Overview

The Musashi-Kosugi district located in suburban Tokyo has seen rapid construction of high-rise residential buildings, resulting in cumulative impacts of multiple development causing issues including exceeding infrastructure capacity and right to light impacts. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) focusing on individual developments have the potential to underestimate impacts for clustered buildings. This report assessed the environmental impacts for the following issues, all of which are ongrowing issues in the current Musashi-Kosugi area.

- access to sunlight
- overpopulation of public education facilities
- congestion of public transport
- impact to the skyline

## Key Results

### Difference in Individual and Cumulative Impacts

The research has discovered the individual EIAs have failed to acknowledge the cumulative impact of multiple developments. 

The impact on shadows were the most clearly illustrated - as shown below.

Even if the shadows from one building affects an area for a small amount of time, having multiple buildings blocking sunlight leads to having the majority of the day without access to sunlight.](img/kosugi/shadow_map.png){width="70%"}

Other interesting results included the change in the perception of the transforming skyline, with a new high-rise development being described as a 'symbolic structure' in early stages, but later changed into 'subtle change' that fits within the given surroundings with multiple high-rises.

### Engagement from EIAs

The engagement from individual development-based EIAs have a spectrum of consideration toward cumulative impacts, depending on the subject. There were issues that were not considered at all (i.e. impact on public transport), issues that had only been considered on an individual basis (right to light, change in skyline) to issues with mitigating measures conducted by the EIA (impact of wind). Not all issues have been considered in the EIA, and some are only considered in an individual scale.
