![The maps created for the #30DayMapChallenge 2023](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sokimura39/30DayMapChallenge/master/2023/Maps/Maps_Gallery.png)

## Overview of Project

The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is a daily mapmaking challenge that involves creating maps every day in November, with themes assigned for every day.

| Year | Personal theme | Number of Maps Made |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| [2024](#sec-2024) | More interactives and 3D | 9 |
| [2023](#sec-2023) | Using R to make 30 maps | 30 |

Works also summarised in the [GitHub repository's webpage](https://sokimura39.github.io/30DayMapChallenge/).

## 2024 {#sec-2024}

My challenge in 2024 was oriented toward interactive maps - find and access from the link below!

:::{#maps2024}

:::

Some static maps were made, using Illstrator, Blender, Python and a bit of AI.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(pixture)

paths <- c(

)

pixgallery(paths, captions, dim = "200px", type = "grid")

```


## 2023 {#sec-2023}

In 2023 I have created all 30 maps in 30 days, with the majority using R (mainly the packages in `tidyverse` - especially `ggplot2`, `sf`, `terra`, and some `rayshader`). For maps generated programatically, the code to generate are available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sokimura39/30DayMapChallenge).

```{r echo=FALSE}

library(pixture)

# create paths
days <- seq(1, 30)
paths <- paste0('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sokimura39/30DayMapChallenge/master/2023/Maps/Day', formatC(days, width = 2, flag = '0'), '.png')

# captions
captions <- c(
  "Day 1 - Points: Santander Docking Stations in London",
  "Day 2 - Lines: Bus Routes in Greater London",
  "Day 3 - Polygons: Green Belts in England",
