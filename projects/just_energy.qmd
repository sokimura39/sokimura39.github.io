## Overview

MA Urban Design's Urban Design Project explored the potential of just energy transitions to propel change in the post-industrial areas of Sheffield: the Wicker, Burngreave, and Attercliffe areas located to the northeast of Sheffield City Centre. 

This was a comprehensive analysis from quantitative and qualitative standpoints, including interviews, GIS analysis, and transect urbanism strategies.
